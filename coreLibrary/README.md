# QuickRLJS

![](/logo/Version_1_dark.svg)

The name of this Project might be a little deceiving. Is it quick? Well it depends. But it certainly is JS, right? Yeah also that is not entirely true. This library is programmed with TypeScript, but what certainly is not a lie is, that this is a Reinforcement Learning Librarie. Like many other libraries in mainly in other programming languages (a big inspiration was [OpenAIGym](https://github.com/openai/gym)) it tries to generalize reinforcement learning concepts. For this use case it offers an intuitive interface for reinforcement learning rnvironment as well as algorithms to be implemented. 

Have fun with this project.
